Apache CXF 4.0.2 Release Notes

1. Overview

The 4.0.x versions of Apache CXF is a significant new version of CXF
that provides several new features and enhancements.  

New features include:
* The release is based on JakartaEE 9.1: the javax.* packages are migrated to jakarta.*
* Support of Spring Framework 6 / Spring Boot 3
* HTTP/2 support

Important notes:
* Many features of CXF 4.x now require Java 17.  While CXF is compiled for Java 11,
many of the dependencies require Java 17 and thus various features may only
work with Java 17.

Users are encouraged to review the migration guide at:
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/40-migration-guide.html
for further information and requirements for upgrading from earlier
versions of CXF.


4.0.2 fixes over 7 JIRA issues reported by users and the community.



2. Installation Prerequisites 

Before installing Apache CXF, make sure the following products,
with the specified versions, are installed on your system:

    * Java 17 Development Kit
    * Apache Maven 3.x to build the samples


3.  Integrating CXF Into Your Application

If you use Maven to build your application, you need merely add
appropriate dependencies. See the pom.xml files in the samples.

If you don't use Maven, you'll need to add one or more jars to your
classpath. The file lib/WHICH_JARS should help you decide which 
jars you need.

Building the samples included in the binary distribution is easy. Change to
the samples directory and follow the build instructions in the README.txt file 
included with each sample.
